Other (very) useful stuffs to get you started in the excited area of NLP

- <https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp> (collection of all NLP learning resources)
- <https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress> (omg...this is like a mini wikipedia for NLP!)
- <https://github.com/mhagiwara/100-nlp-papers> (listed first 100 influential NLP papers)
- <https://captum.ai/tutorials/> (good for working on explanable AI)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:
