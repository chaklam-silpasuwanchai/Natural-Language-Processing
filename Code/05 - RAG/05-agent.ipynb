    "## Agent\n",
    "This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. \n",
    "This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tools`: Descriptions of available tools\n",
    "- `User input`: The high level objective\n",
    "- `Intermediate steps`: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input\n",
    "The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (AgentActions or AgentFinish). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see agent types. You can also easily build custom agents, which we show how to do in the Get started section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving the agent access to the right tools\n",
    "Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent\n",
    "Without thinking through both, you won't be able to build a working agent. If you don't give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don't describe the tools well, the agent won't know how to use them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the tools integrations section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Toolkits\n",
    "For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc.\n",

    "## AgentExecutor\n",
    "The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like:\n",
