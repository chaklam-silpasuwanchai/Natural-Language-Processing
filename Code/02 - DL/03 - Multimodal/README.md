# Multimodal Large Language Models

Determining the order of publication in this case is a bit tricky because different papers might be released publicly at different times even though their official publication date might be the same. However, I can provide some information on the potential order these papers were released based on available information:

1. **ViT (Vision Transformer):** This paper was released in January 2021 along with its code, making it the earliest among the listed models.
2. **BEIT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers):** While the exact release date might be slightly later than ViT, BEIT was also introduced in early 2021.
3. **BLIP-2 (BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models):** This paper was presented at ICLR 2022, which took place in April 2022. Therefore, it's likely to be released after ViT and BEIT.
4. **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training):** CLIP was introduced in January 2021, roughly around the same time as ViT and BEIT. However, the exact order between these three papers in terms of public release might be difficult to pinpoint precisely.
5. **Flamingo (a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning):** Information on the exact release date of Flamingo is currently limited. While it was also presented at ICLR 2022, the specific month or even quarter of its release might not be readily available yet.

Therefore, the most likely order of publication based on currently available information is:

1. ViT
2. BEIT
3. CLIP
4. BLIP-2
5. Flamingo

However, it's important to keep in mind that this is just an estimate based on limited information. The actual order of public release might vary slightly depending on the exact dates and availability of the papers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
